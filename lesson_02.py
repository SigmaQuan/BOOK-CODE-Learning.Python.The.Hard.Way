Exercise 02: Comments and Pound Characters
"""

# A comment, this is so you can read you program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.
print "I could have code like this."  # and comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."
print "This will run."

Study Drills
    1. Find out if you were right about what the # character does and
    make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).
    2. Take your 'lesson_02' file and review each line going backward.
    Start at the last line and check each word in reverse against what you
    should have typed.
    3. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
    4. Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character
    by its name. Did you find more-mistakes? Fix them.
