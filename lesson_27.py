Exercise 27: Memorizing Logic
    Today is the day you start learning about logic. Up to this point you
    have done everything you possibly can reading and writing files, to the
    Terminal, and have learned quite a lot of the math capabilities of
    Python.

    From now on, you will be learning logic. You won't learn complex theories
    that academics love to study but just the simple basic logic that makes
    real programs work and that real programmer need every day.

    Learning logic has to come after you do some memorization. I want you to
    do this exercise for an entire week. Do not falter. Even if you are bored
    out of your mind, keep doing it. This exercise has a set of logic tables
    you must memorize to make it easier for you to do the later exercise.

    I'm warming you this won't be fun at first. It will be downright boring
    and tedious but this teaches you a very important skill you will need as
    a programmer. You will need to be able to memorize important concepts in
    your life. Most of these concepts will be exciting once you get them.
    You will struggle with them, like wresting a squid, then one day you will
    understand it. All that work memorizing the basic pays off big later.

    Here's a tip on how to memorize something without going insane:
        *****
        Do a tiny bit at a time throughout the day and mark down what you
        need to work on most. Do not try to sit down for two hours straight
        and memorize these tables. This won't work.
        *****
        You brain will retain whatever you studied in the first 15 or 30
        minutes anyway. Instead, create a bunch of index cards with each
        column on the left (True or False) on the front, and the column on
        the right on the back. You should then take them out, see the "True
        or False" and immediately say "True"! Keep practicing until you can
        do this.
    *****
    Once you can do that, start writing out your own truth tables each night
    into a notebook. Do not just copy them. Try to do them from memory.
    When you get stuck glance quickly at the ones I have here to refresh your
    memory. Doing this will train your brain to remember whe whole table.

    Do not spend more than one week on this, because you will be applying it
    as you go.

The Truth Terms
    In Python we have the following terms (characters and phrase) for
    determining if something is "True" or "False". Logic on a computer is
    all about seeing if some combination of these characters and some
    variables is True at that point in the program.
        and
        or
        not
        !=
        ==
        >=
        <=
        True
        False

The Truth Tables
    I have remember all the tables. So the following content are omit...
