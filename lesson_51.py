Exercise 51: Getting Input from a Browser

While it's exciting to see the browser display "Hello Wrold", it's
even more exciting to let the user submit text to your application
from a form. In this exercise we'll improve our starter web
application by using forms and storing information about users into
their "sessions".


How the Web Works

Time for some boring stuff. You need to understand a bit more about
how the web works before you can make a form. This description isn't
complete, but it's accurate and will help you figure out what might be
going wrong with your application. Also, creating forms will be easier
if you know what they do.

I'll start with a simple diagram that shows you the different parts of
a web request and how the information flows:

   Your Browser                        Web App's
   http://test.com/                    index.GET
       |(A)                              (D)|
    Network   <--(B)--Internet--(C)-->    My
   Interface                            Server

I've labeled the lines with letters so I can walk you through a regular
request process:
    1. You type in the url http://test.com// into your browser and it
    sends the request on line(A) to your computer's network interface.
    2. Your request goes out over the internet on the line(B) and then
    to the remote computer on line(C) where my server accepts the
    request.
    3. Once my computer accepts it, my web application gets it on
    line(D), and my Python code runs the index.GET handler.
    4. The response comes out of my Python server when I return it, and
    it goes back to your browser over line(D) again.
    5. The server running this site takes the response off line(D) then
    sends it back over the internet on line(C).
    6. The response from the server then comes off the internet on
    line(B), and your computer's network interface hands it to your
    browser on line(A).
    7. Finally, your browser then displays the response.

In this description there are a few terms you should know so that you
have a common vocabulary to work with when talking about your web
application:
    Browser
        The software that you're probably using every day. Most people
        don't know that a browser really does. They just call browsers
        "the internet". Its job is to take address (like
        http://test.com//) you type into the URL bar, then use that
        information to make requests to the server at that address.
    Address
        This is normally a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) like
        http://test.com// and indicates where a browser should go. The
        first part http indicates the protocol you want to use, in
        this case "Hyper-Text Transport Protocol". You can also try
        ftp://ibiblio.org/ to see how "File Transport Protocol" works.
        The http://test.com// part is the "hostname", or a human
        readable address you can remember and which maps to a number
        called an IP address, similar to a telephone number for a
        computer on the Internet. Finally, URLs can have a trailing
        path like the /book/ part of http://test.com//book/ , which
        indicates a file or some resource on the server to retrieve
        with a request. There are many other parts, but those are the
        main ones.
    Connection
        Once a browser knows what protocol you want to use (http), what
        server you want to talk to (http://test.com//), and what
        resource on that server to get, it must make a connection. The
        browser simply asks your operating system (OS) to open a "port"
        to the computer, usually port 80. When it works the OS hands
        back to your program something that works like a file, but is
        actually sending and receiving bytes over the network wires
        between your computer and the other computer at
        http://test.com//. This is also the same thing that happens
        with http://localhost:8080/ but in this case you're telling
        the browser to connect to your own computer (localhost) and
        use port 8080 rather than the default of 80. You could also do
        http://test.com:80/ and get the same result, except you're
        explicitly saying to use port 80 instead of letting it be that
        by default.
    Request
        Your browser is connected using the address you gave. Now it
        needs to ask for the resource it wants (or you want) on the
        remotes server. If you gave /book/ at the end of the URL, then
        you want the file (resource) at /book/, and most servers will
        use the real life /book/index.html but pretend it doesn't
        exist. What the browser does to get this resource is send a
        request to the server. I won't get into exactly how it does
        this, but just understand that it has to send something to
        query the server for the request. The interesting thing is
        that these "resources" don't have to be files. For instance,
        when the browser in your application asks for something, the
        server is returning something your Python code generated.
    Server
        The server is the computer at the end of a browser's connection
        that knows how to answer your browser's requests for files/
        resources. Most web servers just send files, and that's
        actually building a server in Python that knows how to take
        requests for resources, and then return strings that you craft
        using Python. When you do this crafting, you are pretending to
        be a file to the browser, but really it's just code. As you can
        see from Exercise 50, it also doesn't take much code to create
        a response.
    Response
        This is the HTML (CSS, JavaScript, or images) your server wants
        to send back to the browser as the answer to the browser's
        request. In the case of files, it just reads them off the disk
        and sends them to the browser, but it wraps the contents of the
        disk in a special "header" so the browser knows what it's
        getting. In the case of your application, you're still sending
        the same thing, including the header, but you generate that
        data on the fly with your Python code.

That is the fastest crash course in how a web browser accesses
information on servers on the internet. It should work well enough for
you to understand this exercise, but if not, read about it as much as
you can until you get it. A really good way to do that is to take the
diagram and break different parts of the web application you did in
Exercise 50. If you can break your web application in predictable ways
using the diagram, you'll start to understand how it works.


How Forms Work

The best way to play with forms is to write some code that accepts form
data, and then see what you can do. Take your bin/app.py and make it
look like this:
#
# import web
#
# urls = ('/hello', 'index')
#
# app = web.application(urls, globals())
#
# render = web.template.render('templates/')
#
# class index(object):
#     def GET(self):
#         form = web.input(name="Nobody")
#         greeting = "Hello, " % form.name
#
#         return render.index(greeting=greeting)
#
#
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     app.run()
#

Restart it (hit CTRL-C and then run it again) to make sure it loads
again, then with your browser go to http://localhost:8080/hello which
should display, "I just wanted to say Hello, Nobody". Next, change the
URL in your browser to http://localhost:8080/hello?name=Frank and you
will see it say, "Hello, Frank". Finally, change the name=Frank part to
be your name. Now it's saying hello to you.

Let's break down the changes I made to your script.
    1. Instead of just a string for greeting I'm now using web.input to
    get data from the browser. This function takes a key=value set of
    default, parses the ?name=Frank part of the URL you give it, and
    then returns a nice object for you to work with that represents
    those values.
    2. I then construct the greeting from the new form.name attribute
    of the form object, which should be very familiar to you by now.
    3. Everything else about the file is the same as before.

You're also not restricted to just one parameter on the URL. Change
this example to give two variables like this
http://localhost:8080/hello?name=Frank&greet=Hola. Then change the
code to get form.name and form.greet like this:
greeting = "%s, %s" % (form.greet, form.name)

After that, try the URL. Next, leave out he &greet=Hola part so that
you can see the error you get. Since greet doesn't have a default value
in web.input(name="Nobody") then it is a required field. Now go back
and make it have a default in the web.input call to see how you fix
this. Another thing you can do is set its default to greet=None so
that you can check if it exists and then give a better error message,
like this:
#
# form = web.input(name="Nobody", greet=None)
#
# if form.greet:
#     greeting = "%s, %s" % (form.greet, form.name)
# else:
#     return "ERROR: greet s required."
#


Creating HTML Forms

Passing the parameters on the URL works, but it's kind of ugly and not
easy to use for regular people. What you really want is a "POST form",
which is a special HTML file that has a <form> tag in it. This form
will collect information from the user, then send it to your web
application just like you did above.

Let's make a quick one so you can see how it works. Here's the new HTML
file you need to creat, in templates/hello_form.html:
#
# <html>
#     <head>
#         <title>Sample Web Form</title>
#     </head>
# <body>
#
# <h1>Fill Out This Form</h1>
#
# <form action="/hello" method="POST">
#     A Greeting: <input type="text" name="greet">
#     <br/>
#     Your Name: <input type="text" name="name">
#     <br/>
#     <input type="submit">
# </form>
#
# </body>
# </html>
#

You should then change bin/app.py to look like this:
#
# import web
#
# urls =(
#     '/hello', 'index'
# )
#
# app = web.application(urls, globals())
#
# render = web.template.render('templates/')
#
# class index(object):
#     def GET(self):
#         return render.hello_form()
#
#     def POST(self):
#         form = web.input(name="Nobody", greet="Hello")
#         greeting = "%s, %s" % (form.greet, form.name)
#         return render.index(greeting=greeting)
#
# if __name__=="__main__"
#     app.run()
#

Once you've got those written up, simply restart the web application
again and hit it with your browser like before.

This time you'll get a form asking you for "A Greeting" and "Your
name". When you hit the Submit button on the form, it will give you
the same greeting you normally get, but this time look at the URL in
your browser. See how it's http://localhost:8080/hello even though you
sent in parameters.

The part of the hello_form.html file that makes this work is the line
with <form action="/hello" method="POST">. This tells your browser to:
    1. Collect data from the user using the form fields inside the
    form.
    2. Send them to the server using a POST type of request, which is
    just another browser request that "hides" the form fields.
    3. Send that to the /hello URL (as shown in the action="/hello"
    part).

You can then see how the two <input> tags match the names of the
variables in your new code. Also notice that instead of just a GET
method inside class index, I have another method, POST. How this
new application works is:
    1. The browser first hits the web application at /hello but it
    sends a GET, so our index.GET function runs and returns the
    hello_form.
    2. You fill out the form in the browser, and the browser does
    what the <form> says and sends the data as a POST.
    3. The web application then runs the index.POST method rather
    than the index.GET method to handle this request.
    4. This index.POST method then does what it normally does to send
    back the hello page like before. There is really nothing new in
    here, it's just moved into a new function.

As an exercise, go into the templates/index.html file and add a link
back to just /hello so that you can keep filling out the form and
seeing the results. Make sure you can explain how this link works and
it's letting you cycle between templates/index.html and templates/
hello_form.html and what's being run inside this latest Python code.


Creating a Layout Template

When you work on your game in the next exercise, you'll need to make a
bunch of little HTML pages. Writing a full web page each time will
quickly become tedious. Luckily you can create a "layout" template, or
a kind of shell that will wrap all your other pages with common headers
and footers. Good programmers try to reduce repetition, so layouts are
essential for being a good programmer.

Change templates/index.html to be like this:
#
# $def with (greeting)
#
# $if greeting:
#     I just wanted to say <em style="color: green; font-size: 2em;">$greeting</em>.
# $else:
#     <em>Hello</em>, world!
#

Then change templates/hello_form.html to be like this:
#
# <h1>Fill Out This Form</h1>
#
# <form action="/hello" method="POST">
#     A Greeting: <input type="text" name="greet">
#     <br/>
#     Your Name: <input type="text" name="name">
#     <br/>
#     <input type="submit">
# </form>
#

All we're doing is stripping out the "boilerplate" at the top and the
bottom, which is always on every page. We'll put that back into a
single templates/layout.html file that handles it for us from now on.

Once you have those changes, create a templates/layout.html file with
this in it:
#
# $def with (content)
#
# <html>
# <head>
#     <title>Gothons From Planet Percal #25</title>
# </head>
# <body>
#
# $:content
#
# </body>
# </html>
#

This file looks like a regular template, except that it's going to be
passed the contents of the other templates and used to wrap them.
Anything you put in here doesn't need to be in other templates. You
should also pay attention to how $:content is written, since it's a
little different from the other template variables.

The final step is to change the line that makes the render object to
be this:
# render = web.template.render('templates', base='layout')
#

That tells lpthw.web to use the templates/layout.html file as the base
template for all the other templates. Restart your application and
then try to change the layout in interesting ways but without changing
the other templates.


Writing Automated Tests for Forms

It's easy to test a web application with your browser by just hitting
refresh, but come on, we're programmers here. Why do some repetitive
task when we can write some code to test our application? What you're
going to do next is write a little test for your web application form
based on what you learned in Exercise 47. If you don't remember it,
read it again.

*****
You need to do a bit of setup to make Python let you load your
bin/app.py file for testing. When we get to Exercise 52 you'll change
this, but for now create an empty bin/__inti__.py file so Python thinks
bin/ is a directory.

I've also created a simple little function for lpthw.web that lets you
assert things about your web application's response, aptly named
assert_response. Create the file tests/tools.py with these contents:
#
# from nose.tools import *
# import re
#
# def assert_response(resp, contains=None, matches=None, headers=None, status="200"):
#
#     assert status in resp.status, "Expected response %r not in %r" % (status, resp.status)
#
#     if status == "200":
#         assert resp.data, "Response data is empty."
#
#     if contains:
#         assert contains in resp.data, "Response does not contain %r" % contains
#
#     if matches:
#         reg = re.compile(matches)
#         assert reg.matches(resp.data), "Response does not match %r" % matches
#
#     if headers:
#         assert_equal(resp.headers, headers)
#

Once that's in place you can write your automated test for the last
version of the bin/app.py file you created. Created a new file named
tests/app_tests.py with this:
#
# from nose.tools import *
# from bin.app import app
# from tests.tools import assert_response
#
# def test_index():
#     # check that we get a 404 on the / URL
#     resp = app.request("/")
#     assert_response(resp, status="404")
#
#     # test our first GET request to /hello
#     resp = app.request("/hello")
#     assert_response(resp)
#
#     # make sure default values work for the form
#     resp = app.request("/hello", method="POST")
#     assert_response(resp, contains="Nobody")
#
#     # test that we get expected values
#     data = {'name': 'Zed', 'greet': 'Hola'}
#     resp = app.request("/hello", method="POST", data=data)
#     assert_response(resp, contains="Zed")

Finally, use nosetests to run setup and test your web applicaiton:
# $ nosetests

What I'm doing here is I'm actually importing the whole application
from the bin/app.py module, then running it manually. The lpthw.web
framework has a very simple API for processing requests, which looks
like this:
# app.request(localpart='/', method='GET', data=None, host='0.0.0.0:8080',
#             headers=None, https=False)

This means you can pass in the URL as the first parameter, then change
the method of the request, as well as what form data you send,
including the host and headers. This works without running an actually
web server so you can do tests with automated tests and also use your
browser to test a running server.

To validate responses from this function, use the assert_response
function from tests.tools which has:
# assert_response(resp, contains=None, matches=None, headers=None, status="200")
#

Pass int the response you get from calling app.request, then add things
you want checked. Use the contains parameter to make sure that response
contains certain value. Use the status parameter to check for certain
responses. There's actually quite a lot of information in this little
function so it would be good for you to study it.

In the tests/app_tests.py automated test I'm first making sure the /
URL returns a "404 Not Found" response, since it actually doesn't
exist. Then I'm checking that /hello works with both a GET and POST
form. Following the test should be fairly simple, even if you might
not totally know what's going on.

Take some time studying this latest application, especially how the
automated testing works. Make sure you understand how I imported the
application from  bin/app.py and ran it directly for the automated
test. This is an important trick that will lead to more learning.


Study Drills
    1. Read even more about HTML, and give the simple form a better
    layout. It helps to draw what you want to do on paper and then
    implement it with HTML.
    2. This one is hard, but try to figure out how you'd do a file
    upload form so that you can upload an image and save it to the
    disk.
    3. This is even more mind-numbing, but go find the HTTP RFC (which
    is the document that describes how HTTP works) and read as much of
    it as you can. It is really boring but comes in handy once in a
    while.
    4. This will also be really difficult, but see if you can find
    someone to help you setup a web server like Apache, Nginx, or
    thttpd. Try to serve a couple of your .html and .css files with it
    just to see if you can. Don't worrry if you can't. WEb servers kind
    of suck.
    5. Take a break after this and just try making as many different
    web applications as you can. You should definitely read about
    sessions in web.py (which is the same as lpthw.web) so you can
    understand how to keep state for a user.
