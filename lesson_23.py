Exercise 23: Read Some Code
    You should have spent the last week getting your list of symbols straight
    and locked in your mind. Now you get to apply this to another week of
    reading code on the internet. This exercise will be daunting at first.
    I'm going to throw you in the deep end for a few days and have you just
    try your best to read and understand some source code from real project.
    The goal isn't to get you to understand code, but to teach you the
    following three skills:
        1. Finding Python source code for things you need.
            (how about Deep learning?)
        2. Reading through the code and looking for files.
        3. Trying to understand code you find.

    At your level you really do not have the skills to evaluate the things
    you find, but you can benefit from getting exposure and seeing how
    things look.

    When you do this exercise think of yourself as an anthropologist,
    trucking through a new land with just barely enough of the local
    language to get around and survive. Except, of course, that you will
    actually get out alive because the internet isn't a jungle.

    Here's what you do:
        1. Go to bitbucket.org, github.com, or gitorious.org with your
        favorite web browser and search for "Python".
        2. Pick a random project and click on it.
        3. Click on the Source tab and browse through the list of files
        and directories until you find a .py file.
        4. Start at the top and read through the code, taking notes on
        what you think it does.
        5. If any symbols or strange words seem to interest you, write
        them down to research later.

    That's it. Your job is to use what you know so far and see if you
    can read the code and get a grasp of what it does. Try skimming the
    code first, and then read it in detail. Try taking very difficult parts
    and read each symbols you know out loud.

    Now try some of these other sites:
        github.com
        launchpad.net
        gitorious.org
        sourceforge.net
