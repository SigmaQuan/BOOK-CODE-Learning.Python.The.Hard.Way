Exercise 50: Your First Website

These final three exercises will be very hard and you should take your
time with them. In this first one you'll build a simple web version of
one of your games. Before you attempt this exercise you must have
completed Exercise 46 successfully and have a working pip installed
such that you can install packages and know how to make a skeleton
project directory. If you don't remember how to do this, go back to
Exercise 46 and do it all over again.
Installing lpthw.web

Before creating your first web application, you'll first need to
install the "web framework" called lpthw.web. The term "framework"
generally means "some package that makes it easier for me to do
something." In the world of web applications, people create "web
frameworks" to compensate for the difficult problems they've
encountered when making their own sites. They share these common
solutions in the form of a package you can download to bootstrap your
own projects.

In our case, we'll be using the lpthw.web framework, but there are
many, many, many others you can choose from. For now, learn lpthw.web,
then branch out to another one when you're ready (or just keep using
lpthw.web since it's good enough).

Using pip, install lpthw.web:
